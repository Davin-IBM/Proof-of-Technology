We will exploit Spark ML's high-level APIs built on top of DataFrames to create and tune machine learning pipelines. Spark ML Pipelines enable combining multiple algorithms into a single pipeline or workflow. We will utilize Spark ML's feature transformers to convert, modify and scale the features that will be used to develop the machine learning model. Finally, we will evaluate and cross validate our model to demonstrate the process of determining a best fit model and load the results in the database.\n\n### We will use generated travel data that has been examined for patterns of Human Traffickng from dashDB to do the machine learning.  We loaded this data in lab 1.\n\n",

This genenerally is used for binary classifiers, but we will use it because we only have 3 levels of prediction.\n\nThe curve is created by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings. The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity as a function of fall-out. The area under the ROC curve is useful for comparing and selecting the best machine learning model for a given data set. A model with an area under the ROC curve score near 1 has very good performance. A model with a score near 0.5 is about as good as flipping a coin.",
